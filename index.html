			<p>Today we completed our first weekly exam.  I came into class today fairly nervous about the exam hoping I was able to remember everything that we learned over the course of the week.  I have happy to announce that I only got a couple of questions incorrect, and passed our first fumdamentals exam.  I suppose that means that I will advance further into the course which I am pretty stoked about.  After the exam, we spent more time on our personal blog website.  As you can see, I have come pretty far from the first day that I worked on it, and am pretty satisified with the results.  I then downloaded the game Team Fortress 2, which we are suppoed to play a little later.  I have never played before, so we will see how I do.  That's all for now.  Click on the github project link if you want to view my progress with my blog.</p>

			<p>Today we spent the day refining our skills with HTML and CSS.  We took the knowledge from the previous day and applied it towards creating a new website of our own.  This website's focus was to creat a basic blog where we could document our days work.  I have also created git.hub links where all coding projects will be stored and updated as time goes on.</p>

			<p>Today's focus was on creating a website using HTML and CSS.  We stated with a short tutorial, then spent the rest of the day creating our own website.  I was able to complete the project by the end of the day and have attached a git hub link next to the date to review the code.</p>
