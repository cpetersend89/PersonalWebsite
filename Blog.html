			<p>Today's focus was on creating a website using HTML and CSS.  We stated with a short tutorial, then spent the rest of the day creating our own website.  I was able to complete the project by the end of the day and have attached a git hub link next to the date to review the code.</p>

			<p>Today we spent the day refining our skills with HTML and CSS.  We took the knowledge from the previous day and applied it towards creating a new website of our own.  This website's focus was to creat a basic blog where we could document our days work.  I have also created git.hub links where all coding projects will be stored and updated as time goes on.</p>
